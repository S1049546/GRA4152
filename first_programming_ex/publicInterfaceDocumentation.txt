Part of exercise Business P9.23:

For the Country class:

Step 1:
informal list of responsibilities for the Country class:
1. Genereate instances of countries.
2. be able to store variables like name of country, population, area and density
3. be able to return/give access to the same varibales

Step 2:
Specify public interface:

class Country:

    def __init__(self, name, population, area):
    ...

    def get_name(self):
    ...

    def get_population(self):
    ...

    def get_area(self):
    ...

    def get_density():
    ...

Step 3:
Document the public interface:

# # The class holds information about a country, the information is name of the country, population, area and density.
# 
class Country:

 # # Constructs an object of a country, with name, population and area as parameters. 
    #
    def __init__(self, name, population, area):

    # # returns the name of the country
    # @return self._name instance variable that is the name of the country
    #
    def get_name(self):

    # # returns the population of the country
    # @return self._population instance variable that is the population of the country
    #
    def get_population(self):

    # # returns the area of the country
    # @return self._area instance variable that is the area of the country
    #
    def get_area(self):

    # # returns the density of the country
    # @return self._density instance variable that is the density of the country
    #
    def get_density(self):

Step 4:
Determine instance variables:
I need instance variables for name, population, area and density. Beacuase the exercise says those are the ones I need.

Step 5:
See country.py for implementation

Step 6:
see country.py for implementation

Step 7:
See countryTest.py for test of class




For the programme countryInformationFinder.py
Step 1, Informal list of responsibilities:
1. the programme should be able to find highest population, area and density from a list of countries
2. the programme should be able to find highest population, area and density from a dictionary of countries

Step 2, Specify public interface:
def country_finder_for_list(list_of_countries):
...

def country_finder_for_dictionary(country_dict):
...

Step 3, Document the public interface:
# # Finds the countries with largest population, largest area and largest density from a list of countries
# @return a tuple of length 3 with the first element being the country with the largest population, second element being the country with largest area and third the country with largest density
#
def country_finder_for_list(list_of_countries):
...

# # Finds the countries with largest population, largest area and largest density from a dictionary of countries
# @return a tuple of length 3 with the first element being the country with the largest population, second element being the country with largest area and third the country with largest density
#
def country_finder_for_dictionary(country_dict):
...

Step 4, Determine instance variables:
No instance variables. this is not a class this is just a programme with functions.

Step 5:
Irrelevant for this.

Step 6:
See countryInformationFinder.py for implementation of methods

Step 7:
See testCountry for test programme.

Extra:
(I want to add that in the beginning, after reading the example, I thought we were supposed to make a menu of choices for the user.
So that the user could choose if he/she wanted to find either highest population, area or density. So I made a class for that as well.
That is also a part f the test programme.)
